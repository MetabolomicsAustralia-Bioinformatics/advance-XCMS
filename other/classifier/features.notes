# possible features for assessing quality of EIC

1) sigmal maxima
2) range of values (max - min)
3) strength of fit to gaussian function
4) parameters of gaussian function
5) avg intensity of noise surrounding peak
6) relative intensity of 1st 2nd and 3rd thirds of chormatogram
7) difference between rtmin and rtmax
8) difference between mzmin and mzmax

# can get these from xcmsSet objects
9) number of imputed values
10) rtWidth
11) mzWidth
